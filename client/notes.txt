User stories
[ ] As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.
[ ] As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.

[ ] As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.
[ ] As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.
[ ] As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.

[ ] As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. 
	(This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)
