[ ] look into refreshing the token, doing a re login when it expires

DO NOW
-add those nice loading transitions for segment when data is being loaded
--find where first
-error handling for questions that don't exist, should throw 404

==> can be put on hold


Problems
The API does not require auth, yet I still get unauthorized errors... extended token time to 6 hours for now

Notes
On first render, data is being fetched, so it isn't available right away
to mitigate this, do {data.object && what you actually want to render}, this looks ugly..
also what forces the re-render once the data comes in?

Handle failures in the action file, when the service call fails, do a dispatch so show appropiate message
Also think about whether the state needs to be changed on failure, hmm
