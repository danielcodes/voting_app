Frontend things
[x] parametrize the list items into that will link into their own pages, questions/<id>

[ ] highlight proper tab, stuck in home
[ ] have some type of loader before the data is loaded in the page

[ ] look into refreshing the token, doing a re login when it expires

DO NOW
-give the page a make over
--separate choices to vote on to the left and place pie chart on the right

--add those nice loading transitions for segment when data is being loaded
--a descriptive about page

-clean up warnings
-a smudge renders when there is an option but not votes, fix that


Problems
The API does not require auth, yet I still get unauthorized errors... extended token time to 6 hours for now

Notes
On first render, data is being fetched, so it isn't available right away
to mitigate this, do {data.object && what you actually want to render}, this looks ugly..
also what forces the re-render once the data comes in?

Handle failures in the action file, when the service call fails, do a dispatch so show appropiate message
Also think about whether the state needs to be changed on failure, hmm

User stories
[x] As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.
[x] As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.

[x] As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.
[x] As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.
[x] As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.

[x] As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. 
	(This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)

These 2 feel redundant
[x] As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.
[x] As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.
