Things that I need to build out

[x] Separate the user model into its own separate app
--- [ ] look into extending the user model

[x] Extend signature time, too short
[x] Add in the backend for creating polls and options
[x] create custom route for '/questions/:id/choices' to get question choices
[x] Return the username when a user request the JWT, not just the token

DO NOW
[x] Switch out the DB to Postgres
[x] Rewrite views to a more robust form, without viewsets and routers
    --write unit tests which will help prep for cuny codes workshop
[ ] Add in permissions to block certain parts of the API
[ ] Add pagination

TEST OUT THE APP AS A WHOLE WITH THE NEW REWRITE**


Endpoints needed (6)
/questions - get all questions, create a question
GET, POST - needs auth** - done

/questions/<id> - get/delete a question
GET, DELETE - only owner can delete question** - done

/questions/user/<user_id> - get the questions created by a user
GET
/questions/<id>/choices - get the choices of a question
GET

/choices - create a choice
GET, POST - needs auth** - done

/choices/<id> - update a choice (for voting)
GET, PATCH, DELETE

After REST API rewrite -> deploying the API

=====================================================================

Testing the API with httpie
Typical requset goes like this
'http :8000/<path>/'
'http POST :8000/<path> <args>', pass args one by one

since I've got the JWT auth set up, first I need to obtain the token
Also, need to have an additional package, httpie-jwt-auth
Before making the request, need to set up two env variables,
-JWT_AUTH_PREFIX=JWT, this is depends, can be 'Bearer' in other apps
-JWT_AUTH_TOKEN=<token>

You are set, make request with
'http --auth-type=jwt -v <url> <args>'

=====================================================================

Moving the DB from Sqlite to Postgres
-First need to switch to 'postgres' user, 'sudo -u postgres -i', then run 'psql'
-create a user with, '# CREATE USER name;'
--already had user, changed pw, '# ALTER USER user_name WITH PASSWORD 'new_password';'
-create database with, ''# CREATE DATABASE db_name OWNER name;''
-change settings in Django to:
```
	'default': {
		'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
		'NAME': 'myproject',
		'USER': 'myprojectuser',
		'PASSWORD': 'password',
		'HOST': 'localhost',
		'PORT': '',
	}
```

Once the DB has been created,
-dumpdata in current DB to to a json file
-run 'python manage.py migrate --run-syncdb'
-open up shell and delete contenttypes
-load the old data into the new DB

=====================================================================

Forgot to take care of users routes so they broke
Getting an ugly error when the routes are not named, 'user-list' and 'user-detail' respectively

ImproperlyConfigured at /users/
Could not resolve URL for hyperlinked relationship using view name "user-detail". You may have failed to include the related model in your API, or incorrectly configured the `lookup_field` attribute on this field.

Has to do with the serializer being a hyperlinkedmodel and me not defining how to get to the url

=====================================================================
